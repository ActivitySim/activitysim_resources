# activitysim_resources

Welcome to the [ActivitySim](https://activitysim.github.io/) datasets! This repository contains
the necessary data to perform a complete ActivitySim model for several example setups.  Configuration 
files can be found in the main [ActivitySim repository](https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim),
which also stores the core TM1 small scale example data for testing.
